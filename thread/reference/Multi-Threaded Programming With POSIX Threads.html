Knowing how to properly use threads should be part of every computer science 
and engineering student repertoire.
This tutorial is an attempt to help you become familiar with multi-threaded
programming with the POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) threads, or 
pthreads. This tutorial explains the
different tools defined by the pthread library, shows how to use them, and 
gives examples of using them to solve real life programming problems.

<font color=brown><h2>What are threads?</h2></font>
</a>
<p>Technically, a thread is defined as an independent stream of instructions that can 
be scheduled to run as such by the operating system.  
<p>
A thread is a semi-process that has its own stack, and executes a given
piece of code. Unlike a real process, the thread normally shares its memory
with other threads (where as for processes we usually have a different memory
area for each one of them). A Thread Group is a set of threads all executing
inside the same process. They all share the same memory, and thus can access
the same global variables, same heap memory, same set of file descriptors,
etc. All these threads execute in parallel (i.e. using time slices, or if
the system has several processors, then really in parallel).

<font color=brown><h2>What are pthreads?</h2></font>

Historically, hardware vendors have implemented their own proprietary versions of threads. 
These implementations differed substantially from each other, making it difficult for programmers 
to develop portable threaded applications. 

<p>
In order to take full advantage of the capabilities provided by threads, a standardized 
programming interface was required. For UNIX systems, this interface has been specified by 
the IEEE POSIX 1003.1c standard (1995). Implementations which adhere to this standard are 
referred to as POSIX threads, or Pthreads. Most hardware vendors now offer Pthreads in 
addition to their proprietary threads. 

<hr size=4>
<A NAME="threads-processes">
<font color=brown><h2>Threads are efficient ...</h2></font>
<P>
If implemented correctly, threads have some advantages over processes. 
Compared to the standard fork(), threads carry a lot less overhead. 

<p>
Remember that fork() produces a second copy of the calling process. 
The parent and the child are <B><I>completely independent</I></B>, each 
with its own address space, with its own copies 
of its variables, which are completely independent of the same variables 
in the other process. 

<P>Threads share a common address space, thereby avoiding a lot of the 
inefficiencies of multiple processes.

<P><UL>
<LI> The kernel does not need to make a new independent copy of the process 
memory space, file descriptors, etc. 
This saves a lot of CPU time, making thread creation ten to a hundred times 
faster than a new process creation. Because of this, you can use a whole bunch 
of threads and not worry about the CPU and memory overhead incurred. This means 
you can generally create threads whenever it makes sense in your program.
<LI> Less time to terminate a thread than a process.
<LI> Context switching between threads is much faster then context switching
between processes (context switching means that the system switches from
running one thread or process, to running another thread or process)
<LI> Less communication overheads -- communicating between the threads of one process 
is simple because the threads share the address space. 
Data produced by one thread is immediately available to all the other
threads.
</UL>
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, because threads in a group all use the same memory space,
if one of them corrupts the contents of its memory, other threads might
suffer as well. With processes, the operating system normally protects
processes from one another, and thus if one corrupts its own memory space,
other processes won't suffer. 
</p>

<hr size=4>

<A NAME="applications">
<font color=brown><h2>Threads are useful - example applications</A></h2></font>
<p>

<P>
<B>Example 1: A responsive user interface</B>
<p>
One area in which threads can be very helpful is in user-interface programs.
These programs are usually centered around a loop of reading user input,
processing it, and showing the results of the processing. The processing part
may sometimes take a while to complete, and the user is made to wait during
this operation. By placing such long operations in a separate thread, while
having another thread to read user input, the program can be more responsive.
It may allow the user to cancel the operation in the middle.
</p>

<P>
<B>Example 2: A graphical interface</B>
<p>
In graphical programs the problem is more severe, since the application
should always be ready for a message from the windowing system telling it
to repaint part of its window. If it's too busy executing some other
task, its window will remain blank, which is rather ugly. In such a case,
it is a good idea to have one thread handle the message loop of the windowing
systm and always ready to get such repain requests (as well as user input).
Whenever this thread sees a need to do an operation that might take a long
time to complete (say, more then 0.2 seconds in the worse case), it will
delegate the job to a separate thread.

<P>
<B>Example 3 : A Web server </B>
<P><UL>
<LI> It needs to handle several download requests over a short period
<LI> Hence more efficient to create (and destroy) a single thread for each request
<LI> Multiple threads can possibly be executing simultaneously on different processors
</UL>

</a>
<p>
When a multi-threaded program starts executing, it has one thread running,
which executes the main() function of the program. This is already a
full-fledged thread, with its own thread ID. In order to create a new thread,
the program should use the 
<font color=blue><code>
<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908775/xsh/pthread_create.html">pthread_create()</a></code></font> function. 
Here is how to use it:
</p>

<hr width=40%>
<pre><code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;       <font color=brown>/* standard I/O routines                 */</font>
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;     <font color=brown>/* pthread functions and data structures */</font>

    printf("Hello from new thread - got %d\n", my_data);
    <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908775/xsh/pthread_exit.html">pthread_exit</a>(NULL);			<font color=brown>/* terminate the thread */</font>

Understanding the simple threaded program above.
While it does not do anything useful, it will help you understand how threads work. Let us 
take a step by step look at what the program does. 
<ol>
<li> In <code>main()</code> we declare a variable called 
     <font color = blue><code>thread_id</code></font>, which 
     is of type <font color = blue><code>pthread_t</code></font>. 
     This is basically an integer used to identify the 
     thread in the system.
     After declaring <code>thread_id</code>, we call the <code><a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908775/xsh/pthread_create.html">pthread_create</a></code>
     function to create a real, living thread.
<p>
<li> <font color = blue><code><a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908775/xsh/pthread_create.html">pthread_create()</a></code></font> 
     gets 4 arguments The first argument is
     a pointer to <code>thread_id</code>, used by <code>pthread_create()</code> 
     to supply the program with the thread's identifier. 
     The second argument is used to set some
     attributes for the new thread. In our case we supplied a NULL pointer to
     tell <code>pthread_create()</code> to use the default values. 
     Notice that <code>PrintHello()</code> accepts a void * as an argument and 
     also returns a void * as a return value. This shows us that it is possible 
     to use a void * to pass an arbitrary piece of data to our new thread, and 
     that our new thread can return an arbitrary piece of data when it finishes. 
     How do we pass our thread an arbitrary argument? Easy. We use the fourth 
     argument to the <code>pthread_create()</code> call. If we do not want 
     to pass any data to the new thread, we set the fourth argument to NULL.
     <code>pthread_create()</code> returns zero on success and a non-zero value 
     on failure.

<p>
<li> After <code>pthread_create()</code> successfully returns, the program will consist of 
     <font color = "blue">two threads</font>. This is because the main program 
     is also a thread and it executes the code in the
     <code>main()</code> function in parallel to the thread it creates.
     Think of it this way: if you write a program that does not use POSIX threads 
     at all, the program will be single-threaded (this single thread is called 
     the "main" thread). 

<p>
<li> The call to <font color = blue><code><a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908775/xsh/pthread_exit.html">pthread_exit</a></code></font> causes the current thread
     to exit and free any thread-specific resources it is taking. 
</ol>
</p>

<p>
In order to compile a multi-threaded program using <code><u>gcc</u></code>,
we need to link it with the pthreads library. Assuming you have this library
already installed on your system, here is how to compile our first program:
<font color = blue>
<pre><code>      gcc hello.c -o hello -lpthread
</code></pre>
</font>
The source code for this program may be found in the
<a href="./hello.txt">hello.c</a> file.
</p>

<hr size=4>

<a name="exercise_1">
<font color=brown><u>Activity 1</u></font>. Create a directory called 
<code>pthreads</code> in your Unix directory and copy and paste the code for 
<a href="./hello.txt">hello.c</a> 
into the <code>pthreads</code> directory. Compile the source code and ignore the casting warnings (the casts from <tt>int</tt> to <tt>void*</tt> and back to <tt>int</tt> are intentional here, and are used to pass an integer value to the thread function defined with a <tt>void *</tt> argument). 

<p>
Run the 
 <code>hello</code> executable. The ouput should be similar to
<font color = blue>
<pre><code>      Created new thread (4) ...
      Hello from new thread - got 11
</code></pre>
</font> 

<hr>

<a name="exercise_2">
<font color=brown><u>Activity 2</u></font>. A thread can get its own thread id 
by calling 
<code><a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/pthread_self.html">pthread_self</a>()</code>, which returns the thread id:
<font color = blue>
<pre><code>      pthread_t <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/pthread_self.html">pthread_self</a>();
</code></pre></font> 

Use it as
<font color = blue>
<pre><code>      pthread_t tid;
      tid = pthread_self();
</code></pre></font>

Modify the code for <code>hello.c</code> to print out the thread id for both 
threads. Make sure to use the format specifier <tt>%u</tt> (unsigned) to print out 
the thread identifier. On Linux machines the thread identifiers are usually very large values that appear 
to be negative if not interpreted as unsigned integers. 

<p>
Recompile and run the <code>hello</code> executable. 
The new ouput should be similar to
<font color = blue>
<pre><code>      I am thread 1. Created new thread (4) ...
      Hello from new thread 4 - got 11
</code></pre>
</font> 

If you run your code on a Linux machine, the identifier of the new thread will be a very large integer rather than 4 (as shown here). 

<p>
Now modify the code so that the main thread passes its own thread id to the 
new thread it creates. Recompile and run the <code>hello</code> executable. 
The ouput should be similar to
<font color = blue>
<pre><code>      I am thread 1. Created new thread (4) ...
      Hello from new thread 4 - got 1
</code></pre>
</font> 

<hr>

<a name="exercise_3">
<font color=brown><u>Activity 3</u></font>. There are several ways for threads 
to terminate. One way to safely terminate is to call the 
<code><a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908775/xsh/pthread_exit.html">pthread_exit</a></code> routine (the equivalent of <code>exit</code> for processeas). In this activity, 
modify your <code>hello.c</code> program as follows.
<ul>
<li>
In the <code>PrintHello</code> routine, add the line 
<pre>    sleep(1);
</pre>
before the <code>printf</code> call. This causes the calling thread to sleep for 1 second and then resume execution (we are trying to make this thread finish after the main thread). 

<p>
Use the Unix manual pages to find out what header files are needed for the <tt>sleep</tt> function (try manual entries 2, 3, etc. until you find the definition you need). 

<p><li>
In the <tt>main</tt> function, comment out the last statement line which contains 
the <code>pthread_exit</code> call. 
</ul>
Recompile and run the <code>hello</code>
executable. 

<p>
<b>What happens? Why?</b>


<p>Next, add the <code>pthread_exit</code> call back in the main program, but remove 
it from the <code>PrintHello</code> routine. Also add the <code>sleep</code> call 
to the main routine, just before the second <code>printf</code> call, and remove 
it from the <code>PrintHello</code> routine (so now the main thread finishes last). Recompile and run the <code>hello</code>
executable. 

<p>
<b>What happens? Why?</b>
<p>
<font color = brown>
<I>It is necessary to use <code>pthread_exit</code> at the end of the main program.
Otherwise, when it exits, all running threads will be killed.</I></font>

<a name="exercise_4">
<font color=brown><u>Activity 4</u></font>. The <font color=blue><code><a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/pthread_join.html">pthread_join</a>()</code></font> 
function for threads is the equivalent of <code>wait</code> for processes. 
A call to <font color = blue><code><a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/pthread_join.html">pthread_join</a></font></code> 
blocks the calling thread until the thread with identifier equal to the first 
argument terminates.

}

<font color=brown>/* like any C program, program's execution begins in main */</font>
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{

    pthread_t  thread_id;     	       <font color=brown>/* thread's ID (just an integer) */</font>
    int        tid;

    tid = <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/pthread_self.html">pthread_self</a>();

    rc = <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908775/xsh/pthread_create.html">pthread_create</a>(&amp;thread_id, NULL, PrintHello, (void*)tid);

}</pre></code>


The first argument to <code>pthread_join()</code> is the identifier of the thread to join. 
The second argument is a void pointer. 

<font color = blue>
<pre><code>      <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/pthread_join.html">pthread_join</a>(pthread_t tid, void * return_value);
</code></pre>
</font> 

If the <code>return_value</code> pointer is non-NULL, <code>pthread_join</code> will place 
at the memory location pointed to by <code>return_value</code>, 
the value passed by the thread <code>tid</code> through the <code>pthread_exit</code> call.
Since we don't care about return value of the main thread, we set it to NULL.

<p> Recompile and run the executable for the above code. Is the otuput what you expected?

<p><hr>
<p> Note. At any point in time, a thread is either joinable or detached (default state is joinable). 
<i>Joinable</i> threads must be 
reaped or killed by other threads (using <code>pthread_join</code>) in order to free memory resources. 
<i>Detached</i> threads cannot be reaped or killed by other threads, and resources are automatically 
reaped on termination. So unless threads need to synchronize among themselves, it is 
better to call
<font color = blue>
<pre><code>      <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/pthread_detach.html">pthread_detach</a>(pthread_self());
</code></pre>
</font>
instead of <code>pthread_join</code>. 
 <p>
<hr>
<a name="exercise_5">
<font color=brown><u>Activity 5</u></font>. Write a program <code>hellomany.c</code> 
that will create a number N of threads specified in the command line, each of which 
prints out a hello message and its own thread ID. To see how the execution of the 
threads interleaves, make the main thread sleep for 1 second for every 4 or 5 threads 
it creates. The output of your code should be similar to:

<font color = blue>
<pre><code>       I am thread 1. Created new thread (4) in iteration 0...
